My name is Nan Jiang (姜楠). I'm a PhD candidate at the Department of Computer Science, at Purdue University. 
I am fortunate to be supervised by Professor [Yexiang Xue](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/yexiang/). 
<!-- Previously, I obtained my master's degree at Beihang University  under the supervision of Professor [Wenge Rong](https://wgrong.github.io/) and a bachelor's degree at the Zhejiang University of Technology. -->

## Research Interests

My PhD research focuses on Machine Learning with Constraint Reasoning and symbolic regression for scientific discovery. 


## Research Highlights

### AI-driven Scientific Discovery

- We propose an end-to-end framework to learn physics models in the form of Partial Differential Equations (PDEs) directly from the experiment data.
- We scale up learning first-principle models harnessing randomized algorithms, exploiting the fact that the temporal evolutions of many physical systems often consist of gradually changing updates across wide areas in addition to a few rapid updates concentrated in a small set of “interfacial” regions.
- The development of AI-driven scientific discovery approaches was motivated by the real-world application of learning the physics model of nano-scale crystalline defects in materials under extreme conditions.


### Constraint Reasoning Embedded in Machine Learning

- We propose COnstraint REasoning embedded structured learning (CORE), a scalable constraint reasoning and machine learning integrated approach for learning over structured domains.
- We embed decision diagrams, a popular constraint reasoning tool, as a fully differentiable module into deep learning models.
- In data-driven operational research and program synthesis from the natural language, the structures generated with CORE satisfy 100% of the constraints when using exact decision diagrams. In addition, CORE boosts learning performance by reducing the modeling space via constraint satisfaction.
CORE also generates designs that satisfy complex user specifications as well as meet aesthetics, utility, and convenience requirements.
