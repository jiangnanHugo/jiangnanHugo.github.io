Sampling from multiple discrete items with diverse probability is relatively **slow**. When applying the noise contrastive estimation method, the intuitive sampling method becomes a bottleneck for the model's training. So we apply the alias method for generating samples from the given noise distribution.



#### Generate Samples
if you want to generate many samples from the distribution, and don't want specific tokens to be appear.
1. generate 1 sample, check whether this sample is not equal to your specific token. then loop though this step, until you get as much samples as you want. (slow)
2. generate 3 times more samples and remove the specific tokens in this list. (relatively faster)
